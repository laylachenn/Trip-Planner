# My Personal Project - Travel Planner

**PROPOSAL**

- The application will be a travel planner where you can create different trips, such as a Europe trip, trip to the
tropical islands, etc. You will be able to add different details and information to the trip such as destinations,
hotels, flights, dates. The main focus will be on creating a planner where all travel information is easily accessible 
to view and compare different trips and the experiences. The main target audience will be on people who travel a lot
like for work or to visit family, or just a simple vacation. This project is of interest to me because I love
travelling and I want to make it easier for people to plan their trips and relax on their vacation. The user will be
able to create multiple different trips and itineraries, and view a couple preset vacations if they're looking for some
inspiration on where to go. After the trip, they'll be able to write a review on their experience and store it so that
in the future they can see their notes when planning their next trip. For example the review could be "Don't forget to 
pack a winter jacket when visiting New York in the fall, as it can get icy but overall great experience. Budget
a little more than you usually would as it is an expensive city."
