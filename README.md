# My Personal Project - Travel Planner

**PROPOSAL**

- The application will be a travel planner where you can create different trips, such as a Europe trip, trip to the
tropical islands, etc. You will be able to add different attributes to the trip such as destinations, hotels, flights,
dates. The main focus will be on creating an itinerary and tracking expenses for each trip, so it will be easier to
visualize how much a Europe trip would cost if you go on a daily basis. The main target audience will be on people who
travel a lot like for work or to visit family, or just a simple vacation. This project is of interest to me because I
travelling as well as personal finance. Managing expenses and creating budgets are an important part to everyone's life
and people should be able to travel and relax without worrying about how much the cost of the trip is. We will be able
to see different flights and choose between them, and be able to set budget limits for each trip. The user will be able
to create as many different trips and itineraries as they wish, and then be able to compare the different information,
and filter by most expensive, least expensive, most amount of stuff to do, etc.
