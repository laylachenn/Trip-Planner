# My Personal Project - Travel Planner

**PROPOSAL**

//EDIT THIS

- The application will be a travel planner where you can create different trips, such as a Europe trip, trip to the
tropical islands, etc. You will be able to add different attributes to the trip such as destinations, hotels, flights,
dates. The main focus will be on creating an itinerary and tracking expenses for each trip, so it will be easier to
visualize how much a Europe trip would cost if you go on a daily basis. The main target audience will be on people who
travel a lot like for work or to visit family, or just a simple vacation. This project is of interest to me because I
love travelling and I want to make it easier for people to plan their trips and relax on their vacation. The user will be able
to create as many different trips and itineraries as they wish, and then be able to compare the different information,
and filter by most expensive, least expensive, most amount of stuff to do, etc.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to add a trip to a list, and add its details such as flight options, number of days, hotels and
destinations.
- As a user, I want to be able to view my list of trips, and its different information in order to make it easy to see
the different trip options and compare itineraries.
- As a user, I want to be able to view a few presets of trips in order to get some inspiration for my vacation, and
take the preset and have the option to add it to my trip list and modify it to my choosing.
- As a user, I want to be able to select a trip and create a post-travel review and save the review with my trip, so I
can see it at a later date.
