# My Personal Project - Travel Planner

**PROPOSAL**

- The application will be a travel planner where you can create different trips, such as a Europe trip, trip to the
tropical islands, etc. You will be able to add different attributes to the trip such as destinations, hotels, flights,
dates. The main focus will be on creating an itinerary and tracking expenses for each trip, so it will be easier to
visualize how much a Europe trip would cost if you go on a daily basis. The main target audience will be on people who
travel a lot like for work or to visit family, or just a simple vacation. This project is of interest to me because I
love travelling as well as personal finance. Managing expenses and creating budgets are an important part to everyone's 
life and people should be able to travel and relax without worrying about how much the trip costs. We will be able
to see different flights and choose between them, and be able to set budget limits for each trip. The user will be able
to create as many different trips and itineraries as they wish, and then be able to compare the different information,
and filter by most expensive, least expensive, most amount of stuff to do, etc.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to add a trip, and add its details such as flight options, day to day itineraries, number
of days and hotels.
- As a user, I want to be able to view my list of trips, and its different information in
order to make it easy to see the different trip options and compare budgets.
- As a user, I want to be able to filter my list of trips by different filters like price, most hotel options, etc.
- As a user, I want to be able to select a trip and rate it and create a review of my experience, so I can refer to it
in the future.
